I am an **Infrastructure Engineer** at Peopleâ€™s United Bank. I focus on Linux, DevOps, containerization, and AWS.

I primarily write Ansible and Terraform code as part of our Infrastructure as Code initiative.  My main programming language is Python and I am also currently learning C.

My other interests are jiu jitsu, Muay Thai, hiking and cars.

I can be reached at nessad.choudhury@gmail.com.
