I am an *Infrastructure Engineer* at a Peopleâ€™s United Bank. I focus on Linux, DevOps, containerization, and AWS.

I primarily write Ansible and Terraform code as part of our Infrastructure as Code initiative.  My main programming language is Python and I am also currently learning C.

My other interests are jiu jitsu, May Thai, hiking and cars.
